#  Urban Planning Research Tool
 
This is a small web app I built to explore how different factors like **clean environment** and **transport systems**affect the quality of life in a city.

The idea is:  
You enter some basic data about a city, and the app gives you a score and explanation based on custom logic.


##  What does this project do?

You can enter things like:

- Population  
- Green space percentage  
- Public transport availability  
- Carbon emissions  
- Peak hour traffic  

Based on that, the app tells you:

- How healthy and livable the city is  
- Where the city is doing well  
- Where it needs improvement  



## Why I made this

I built this project while learning React and web development.  
But more than that, I wanted to understand how **real-world city problems** can be turned into logic and code.

This project helped me learn:
- How to design my own logic models  
- How to think like a planner, not just a coder  
- How data can tell a story about a city
